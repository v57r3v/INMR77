Module learning outcomes to be assessed 
1.          Demonstrate an understanding of the concepts of business intelligence and data mining and its relevant theory and techniques 
2.          Demonstrate an understanding of how and when data mining can be used as a problem- solving technique in a range of organisational contexts 
3.          Develop theoretical and practical skills to address different data types for creation of business intelligence in a range of organisational contexts. 
4.          Apply appropriate data mining process frameworks and use relevant data mining techniques and methods for data modelling and business solution design.

4. What   is   required   of   me   in this   assessment? 
Guidelines/details of how to prepare your submission 
• Read the coursework specification and follow the instruction carefully, address all required elements 
• Exercise your critical thinking, critical analysis and critical writing skills 
o justify your statements by providing 
evidence/support using relevant literature, and avoid unsubstantiated statements; 
o ensure logical argumentation 
o Weigh between options 
• At this masters level you are expected to demonstrate your ability to research, data modelling, reference and apply with rea代 写INMR77 Business Intelligence and Data Mining 2024-25R
代做程序编程语言son knowledge, technique and methods about data 
mining for business intelligence. 
• You are expected to demonstrate evidence of critical 
reasoning, data analysis and insight to support data driven decision making. 
Expectations for group work (if applicable) 

Self-regulation: Make sure that you … 
• Read the case scenario and coursework specification 
carefully and provide what was requested and following the guidelines asset out in the coursework document. 
• Make sure to apply suitable techniques, methods and models learned to the case scenario and data set given. 
• Do not omit any of the section/question. Note: the main report document will be submitted separately to the supplement data files, there will be two different submission entries on Blackboard) 
Three key pieces of advice 
based on the feedback given to the previous cohort who completed this assignment 
1.          Read the coursework carefully and understand what are required. 
2.          Start the work earlier and don’t leave it to the last minute. 
3.          Be inquisitive, play with the data, use suitable methods and techniques, and make sure to justify the approaches taken. 
Formative assessment opportunities/activities 
Formative assessment is any task or activity which creates 
feedback (or feedforward) for you about your learning, but 
which does not contribute towards your overall module mark. All lectures will indicate the core material, models, techniques etc with an introduction to these. These are followed by tutorial workshops where discussions and exercises applying the methods and techniques in a given business scenario/datasets will be carried out. Feedback will be provided at the end of each workshop for improvements and further considerations. 
5. What   resources   might   I   use   to   prepare   my work? Please use the lectures and tutorials, papers and references and other resources as listed in the coursework document, and further resources/materials as provided on the lecture slides and lab tutorial sessions on blackboard, including: 
• University library – books, online databases, articles. 
• Models/theories/concepts/framework covered in classes, 
• Further reading and references provide for each unit 
• Materials/Resources/exercises/videos provide on the BB. 
• As a Master student, you are also expected to conduct further research and take your own initiatives for your work.
